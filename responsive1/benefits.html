        </header>
        <p> It's true, Bespoke makes healthy and affordable snack food that makes eating right enjoyable. But Bespoke also protects people in need. Bespokes homelesness outreach project, Bespoke Cares, helped house nearly thirteen million endangered youths in 2016. This number continues to grow exponentially each year. Some estimate that 1 in every 1 child has received assistance from Bespoke cares. At Bespoke, we like to see the good in the world. And what better way to foster love and charity in the world than to nurture the next generation? Support us as we pay it forward to those who need it most.</p>
