        <h2>Proprosed dwelling structures design concepts</h2>
        <p>Mars' atmosphere is over 100 times thinner than earth's, meaning that a protective suit must be worn during any EVA, or extravehicular activity. This also means that any habitat or housing structure must be airtight and climate controlled so that people can survive inside it. Supplying long-term housing for people on Mars is of course the eventual goal of the Project, but this is a very cost-intensive undertaking. Our researchers are finding ways to make affordability and safety align in just the right way, so that the future of mankind can rest safely on a different planet.</p>

        <h2>Artist's rendering of Mars dwelling pods</h2>
        <p>Shelters would likely consist of one or two-person pods with a bedroom, bathroom and minimal living space. These would all be connected by an oxygen tube shaft that would run through the camp, but each would be able to seal off in case of a rupture or other emergency and create oxygen independently of the system. The pods would contain only the bare necessities and a few personal items from each member of the team. Crews would live at very close quarters at first, but our hopes are that through the efforts of the first teams larger, more permanent structures can be erected that will stand against the elements and make Mars truly inhabitable.</p>
        <h6>Did they say it was an accident? It wasn't. They've been orchestrating all, from the note to the weapon with my fingerprints.</h6>

        <h2>Proprosed layout of a colony</h2>
        <p>A colony would be a Mars “neighborhood” of several pods, a common gathering area known as the colony oasis, a designated bathroom structure and several labs and greenhouses, as well as a garage of sorts for rovers and other vehicles. This would serve as a base of operations for expeditions, a research center for our botanists and scientists, and a test run of housing solutions and the livability of a colony system. The first team to go to Mars will take with them the raw materials for the beginning of the first colony, and it will be added onto during the subsequent years as more of our team can make the trip. Projected to be set up near the Daedalia Planum because of this area’s predominantly smooth and featureless landscape, such a colony would be an investment of trillions of dollars, but the data that could be collected would be orders of magnitude greater than anything ever documented by a rover or satellite.</p>
         <h6>It seemed like an easy fix, but I'm waiting for you on your "uninhabitable" planet. I've had a long time to plan this.</h6>
