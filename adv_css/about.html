            <h2>Bespoke's Packaging and Logo</h2>
            <p>Over the years, Bespoke has evolved into a cohesive and vibrant brand, its visual identity fluently lending itself to the many branches and products under the Bespoke name. At once rugged, minimalist, classic, and clean, the Bespoke Logo in all its forms is an integral part of the Brand's success. </p>

    <h3>Bespoke through the years</h3>
    <p>Bespoke has taken many forms over time. Originally, our logo was a cheerful, smiling sun with a cane in hand, walking along a rainbow road. Then in 1994 we upgraded. Talented artist and designer Miz Laroseph created the Bespoke Boy - a happy go lucky kid with rosy cheeks and flaming red hair to embody our drive and veractiy. Again we updated our look in 1999 to a sleek typographic logo. We soon realized that text alone simply couldn't convey the depth of who we are and in 2003 we adopted the green hill and sun logo you all know and love today.</p>
