<h1>I will not give my name</h1>

<h2>Confession:</h2>
<br>


<p>Hugh Bevander did not commit suicide. He could not be coerced into what we deemed ethical, what we told ourselves was necessary. We branded him an idealist, a purist, a prude. We said he was obstructing progress. We claimed the old Hugh would beg us to remove the obstacle from the path. I didn't believe the lies even as they left my lips. The lies I was told to say, to tell myself, because at that point, Hugh, I couldn't even look you in the eyes for the guilt I felt. Maybe I was weak. I was weak. But even if I had been strong, a plan was in motion that I could do nothing to stop. Dead whistleblowers don't make headlines anymore. Anyway the Project is harvesting the trees to make the paper the news is printed on. Our satellites are the ones sending the news to the tvs of the world. The truth is what we say it is. What he says it is. Nothing that goes on here isn't known. As I write this, he's proofreading. Somewhere. I know it. But I had to do something, say something for my own conscience. I couldn't not confess. Even if it's to nobody. This will never go live, we've always been meticulous to a fault. I know that; I don't delude myself to dream I'm doing good. But I confessed, in a small way, my name is cleared. I can rest. This world is quickly becoming a place I don't feel at home in.</p>
