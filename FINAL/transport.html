            <h2>A prototype Mars Ground Transport Vehicle</h2>
            <p>Rovers have been patrolling the unforgiving surface of Mars since the later 90's. To even carry their own weight through the desolate landscape was quite a feat. They were built to be light, sturdy and durable, with no extraneous screw or rivet adding unnecessary weight. When considering a design for a Mars vehicle to transport people, the priorities shift and some difficult equations come up. The machine must have a climate controlled interior with enough space for a few people and supplies, ideally enough to sustain a team of three for 48 hours. The vehicle would need wide tires to account for the uneven terrain and a thickly plated window with a comprehensive view of its surroundings. The engine would need to be both incredibly fuel efficient and powerful to propel its passengers to their destinations safely.</p>

            <h2>A proposed "greenhouse truck"</h2>
            <p>Researchers in the science division of the Project have begun assembling a "greenhouse truck" which would be used to move seedlings between labs and greenhouses in different locations on Mars to see how different areas and altitudes affect the growth and development of plants. This vehicle would house a driver, one passenger to maintain the cargo, and a third team member who would walk alongside the slow moving vehicle to guide it through the least obstructed path when visibility is compromised.</p>

            <h2>Artist's interpretation of a Mars drone</h2>
            <p>Drones are used widely here on earth, from everything to filming and photography, grocery deliveries, personal recreation, and more recently, even transportation. While the effectiveness of flying machines in Mars' thin atmosphere has not been tested, it has been proposed that helicopter or drone-like technology can be utilized to make personal flying machines that would make traversing the many crags and craters of Mars a thousand times simpler. Driving from location to location on the surface of the red planet would be time intensive and costly, while a flight could be made in a matter of minutes. Storms and dust devils are common on Mars, however, and such phenomenons would render flying hazardous.</p>
